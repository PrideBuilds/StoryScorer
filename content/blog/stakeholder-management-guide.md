You can write the perfect user story, but if the key stakeholder hates it, you've failed. Stakeholder management is the "hidden" skill that separates junior BAs from seniors.

## Who is a Stakeholder?
Anyone impacted by the project.
- **The Sponsor** (pays the bills)
- **The User** (uses the system)
- **Compliance/Legal** (sets the rules)
- **The Ops Team** (supports it)

## Strategies for Engagement

### 1. Map Your Stakeholders
Use a Power/Interest Grid.
- **High Power, High Interest:** Manage Closely. Engage daily/weekly.
- **High Power, Low Interest:** Keep Satisfied. Updates only.
- **Low Power, High Interest:** Keep Informed. They will be your champions.

### 2. Speak Their Language
- Talk **ROI** to the CFO.
- Talk **Efficiency** to the Operations Manager.
- Talk **Experience** to the End User.

### 3. "No" is a Complete Sentence (Sometimes)
You can't please everyone. When requests conflict, refer back to the project goals. Be transparent about trade-offs.

## The "Silent" Stakeholder
Don't forget the people who aren't in the room but will be affected. Speak up for them.

## Conclusion
Great products are built *with* people, not just *for* them. Building relationships is just as important as building features.
