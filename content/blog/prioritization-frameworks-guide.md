The hardest part of product management isn't deciding what to build—it's deciding what *not* to build. With limited resources and unlimited ideas, you need a framework to cut through the noise. Here are three of the best.

## 1. MoSCoW Method

Best for: **Release planning and stakeholder alignment.**

Categorize features into key buckets:
- **M - Must Have:** Non-negotiable requirements. If these are missing, the project fails.
- **S - Should Have:** Important but not vital. Can be workarounds.
- **C - Could Have:** "Nice to have." Include if time permits.
- **W - Won't Have:** Agreed to start out of scope for now.

## 2. RICE Scoring

Best for: **Comparing disparate ideas objectively.**

Assign a score based on the formula: `(Reach * Impact * Confidence) / Effort`

- **Reach:** How many people will this affect?
- **Impact:** How much will it move the needle? (0.25 to 3)
- **Confidence:** How sure are we? (0 to 100%)
- **Effort:** Person-months to build.

A high RICE score indicates a "quick win" or high-value project.

## 3. The Kano Model

Best for: **Balancing customer satisfaction.**

Classifies features based on how they affect customer delight:
- **Basic Needs (Must-be):** Customer expects them. No credit for having them, big failure if missing (e.g., car brakes).
- **Performance Needs (One-dimensional):** More is better (e.g., car gas mileage).
- **Delighters (Excitement):** Unexpected features that wow users (e.g., free snacks).

## Conclusion

There is no "perfect" framework. The best one depends on your context.
- Use **MoSCoW** for deadlines.
- Use **RICE** for growth teams.
- Use **Kano** for design and UX strategy.

Whichever you choose, ensure the features you prioritize are well-defined. [StoryScorer](/signup) can help ensure your "Must Haves" are documented clearly.
