One of the most common challenges agile teams face is **large user stories**. A story that is too bit to fit in a sprint (often called an "Epic") leads to carry-over, inaccurate estimations, and team frustration.

The solution? **Story Splitting.**

## Why Split Stories?

- **Better Flow**: Small stories move through the development pipeline faster.
- **Faster Feedback**: You can release parts of a feature and get user feedback sooner.
- **Reduced Risk**: If a small story fails, it's a small failure. If a huge story fails, it's a disaster.

## How NOT to Split Stories

Do not split stories horizontally (e.g., "Database Layer", "UI Layer", "API Layer"). This results in "stories" that provide no value on their own.

Instead, split **vertically**. Each slice should touch all layers and deliver a tiny slice of working functionality.

## The SPIDR Method

A popular framework for splitting stories is **SPIDR**:

### S - Spikes

If you don't know how to build it, create a time-boxed research story (Spike) first.

### P - Paths

Split by alternative paths.

- _Original_: "As a user, I want to pay for my order."
- _Split 1_: "...pay with Credit Card."
- _Split 2_: "...pay with PayPal."

### I - Interfaces

Split by device or interface.

- _Original_: "As a user, I want to view reports."
- _Split 1_: "...on iOS."
- _Split 2_: "...on Desktop Web."

### D - Data

Split by data types or variations.

- _Original_: "As a user, I want to search for products."
- _Split 1_: "...search by name."
- _Split 2_: "...search by category."

### R - Rules

Split by business rules. Relax constraints for the first version.

- _Original_: "As a user, I want to buy tickets."
- _Split 1_: "...buy tickets (no quantity limit)."
- _Split 2_: "...enforce purchase limits."

## Conclusion

Splitting stories is an art that requires practice. But by focusing on vertical slices and using techniques like SPIDR, you can keep your backlog healthy and your team flowing.
