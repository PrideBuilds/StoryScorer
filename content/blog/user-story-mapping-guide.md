A flat product backlog is just a long list of "to-dos." It lacks context, narrative, and flow. Enter **User Story Mapping**, a technique popularized by Jeff Patton that turns your flat list into a 2D map of the user's journey.

## What is a Story Map?

Imagine a wall covered in sticky notes.

- **Top Row (The Backbone):** The high-level user activities (e.g., "Search for Product", "Add to Cart", "Checkout").
- **Vertical Columns:** The detailed user stories or tasks required to complete that activity, ordered by priority.

## Benefits of Story Mapping

1.  **See the Big Picture:** It forces the team to think about the entire user flow, not just isolated features.
2.  **Better Prioritization:** You can slice the map horizontally to define releases (MVP, V1, V2).
3.  **Identify Gaps:** It's easier to spot missing steps in a visual journey than in a spreadsheet.

## How to Build a Story Map

### Step 1: Frame the Problem

Define the product vision and the target user persona.

### Step 2: Map the Backbone

Identify the major steps in the user's journey. Arrange them left-to-right in chronological order.
_Example: Sign Up -> Create Profile -> Search -> Buy -> Review._

### Step 3: Brainstorm Details

For each backbone step, brainstorm the specific tasks or stories needed. Stack them vertically under the step.
_Example under "Search": Filter by price, Search by keyword, View recent searches._

### Step 4: Slice for Releases

Draw horizontal lines across the map.

- The top slice is your **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product)—the absolute essentials to walk the backbone.
- Lower slices are future releases.

## Conclusion

User Story Mapping bridges the gap between a vision and a backlog. It keeps the user at the center of the conversation and ensures you are building a cohesive product, not just a pile of features.
