In 2001, Ron Jeffries introduced a concept that changed how we think about requirements: the **3 C's of User Stories**. It reminds us that a user story isn't a specification—it's a placeholder for collaboration.

## 1. Card (The Placeholder)
Historically, stories were written on 3x5 index cards.
- **Purpose:** To act as a "token" or reminder that there is a feature to discuss.
- **Content:** The "As a/I want/So that" statement. It embodies the requirement but doesn't contain all the details.

## 2. Conversation (The Exchange)
This is the most critical part. The written text is imperfect.
- **Purpose:** To build shared understanding.
- **Action:** The Product Owner, Developers, and Testers talk. They ask questions, sketch diagrams, and challenge assumptions.
- **Outcome:** Knowledge transfer that is far richer than any document.

## 3. Confirmation (The Verification)
How do we know we are done?
- **Purpose:** To record the agreement.
- **Content:** These are the **Acceptance Criteria**. They confirm that the code matches the conversation.

## Why This Matters Today
In the digital age of Jira and Azure DevOps, we often forget the **Conversation**. We treat the ticket (Card) as a contract.
- *Don't just hand off a ticket.*
- *Talk about it.*

## Conclusion

If your team is struggling with misunderstandings, check your 3 C's. are you skipping the Conversation?

Make sure your Confirmation (Acceptance Criteria) is solid. Use [StoryScorer](/signup) to check if your criteria are testable and clear.
