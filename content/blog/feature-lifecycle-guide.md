Ever wonder what happens after you click "Submit" on a feature request? The journey from an idea to live code is a complex pipeline of verification and creation. Let's walk through the lifecycle of a healthy feature.

## Stage 1: Ideation & Discovery

**Status:** _Backlog_

- **Activity:** The Product Owner talks to users. A problem is identified.
- **Artifact:** A raw idea or a "One-Pager."

## Stage 2: Definition (The 3 Cs)

**Status:** _Refinement_

- **Activity:** The team discusses the idea. The User Story is written. Acceptance Criteria are defined.
- **Gate:** Definition of Ready (DoR).

## Stage 3: Implementation

**Status:** _In Progress_

- **Activity:** Developers write code.
- **Ideally:** They write tests _first_ (TDD/BDD).
- **Collaboration:** Code Review (Pull Request) occurs here. Peer review is safer than working alone.

## Stage 4: Verification

**Status:** _QA / Testing_

- **Activity:** Automated CI/CD pipelines run. QA analysts perform exploratory testing.
- **Gate:** Definition of Done (DoD).

## Stage 5: Release & Feedback

**Status:** _Deployed_

- **Activity:** The feature goes live. Users touch it. Analytics track usage.
- **Loop:** Feedback here informs Stage 1 for the next feature.

## Conclusion

Understanding this lifecycle helps BAs and POs understand _where_ their work fits. Writing a clear story in Stage 2 saves headaches in Stage 4.
