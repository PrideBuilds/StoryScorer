In Agile development, ambiguity is the enemy. To combat this, teams use two powerful agreements: the **Definition of Ready (DoR)** and the **Definition of Done (DoD)**. They sound similar, but they serve very different purposes at different ends of the development cycle.

## The Definition of Ready (DoR)

**The DoR is the starting line.** It's a checklist that a user story must meet _before_ it can be pulled into a sprint.

### Why DoR Matters:

- Prevents "half-baked" stories from entering the sprint.
- Ensures the team (Developers, QA) understands _what_ to build.
- Reduces mid-sprint blockers.

### Example DoR Checklist:

1.  [ ] User story follows the INVEST criteria.
2.  [ ] Acceptance Criteria are clear and testable.
3.  [ ] Dependencies are identified and resolved.
4.  [ ] UX designs/mockups are attached (if applicable).
5.  [ ] Story is estimated (e.g., Story Points).

## The Definition of Done (DoD)

**The DoD is the finish line.** It's a checklist of quality standards that _every_ story must meet to be considered complete and releasable.

### Why DoD Matters:

- Ensures high quality and prevents technical debt.
- Creates transparency—everyone knows what "done" truly means.
- Prevents the "It's done, but..." syndrome ("It's done, but not tested").

### Example DoD Checklist:

1.  [ ] Code is written and reviewed.
2.  [ ] Unit tests passed with >80% coverage.
3.  [ ] Acceptance criteria verified by QA.
4.  [ ] No P1/P2 bugs.
5.  [ ] Documentation updated.
6.  [ ] Deployed to staging environment.

## Key Differences

| Feature   | Definition of Ready (DoR)         | Definition of Done (DoD)               |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **When?** | Before Sprint Planning            | During/End of Sprint                   |
| **Focus** | Clarity & Feasibility             | Quality & Completeness                 |
| **Goal**  | Is it safe to start?              | Is the product potentially releasable? |
| **Owner** | Product Owner (supported by Team) | Development Team                       |

## Conclusion

Using both DoR and DoD creates a "quality sandwich" around your sprint. DoR ensures you start right, and DoD ensures you finish strong.
